## GLMs and Regression Trees

- GLMs extend ordinary linear regression (least squares) to responses from any exponential family (gamma, Poisson, binomial etc.)
- All the information from a $p$-parameter GLM is summarised in a $p$-parameter vector, making it still interpretable for large $N$
- GLMs minimise the total deviance betweem the data and the params, analagous to least squares
