## Empirical Bayes

# Robbins' Formula

- Used to estimate the prior from the data
- Approximation to a fully Bayesian Hierarchical model, and is one approach to setting hyperparameters. The hyperparameters are point estimates rather than distributions in the usual Hierarchical case.
- Poisson count data gives a nice recursive formula for $E(\theta|x)$ in the insurance claim example, using the marginal densities
- The prior can be parameterised still and the formula used as before, just with the parameterised marginal densities (which use the MLE parameters themselves)
- The formula can be used for the "missing-species problem" as seen in 6.2
