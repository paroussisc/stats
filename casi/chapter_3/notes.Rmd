## Bayesian Inference

- Jeffreys prior is invariant to parameter transformation

# A Bayesian/Frequentist Comparison List

- Choice of prior vs choice of method/algorithm
- Flexibility of frequentism works well with modern data analysis problems since it deals with specific algorithms
- Only a single distribution needed when working in a Bayesian framework and it answers all the questions at once, compared to a frequentist approach where different estimators for different questions
- Simplicity is appealing in dynamic contexts where data is arriving sequentially. Bayes' theorem is a useful tool for combining different statistical evidence from disparate sources
- Classical frequentism can be argued to be the most scientifically objective
- Computer-age statistical inference at its most successful combines elements of the two philosophies
