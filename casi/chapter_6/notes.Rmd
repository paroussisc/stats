## Empirical Bayes

# Robbins' Formula

- Used to estimate the prior from the data
- Approximation to a fully Bayesian Hierarchical model, and is one approach to setting hyperparameters  
- Poisson count data gives a nice recursive formula for $E(\theta|x)$ in the insurance claim example, using the marginal densities
