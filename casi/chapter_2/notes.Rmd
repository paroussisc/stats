## Frequentist Inference

# Frequentism in practice

* The plug-in principle - use standard errors of the mean of the data
* Taylor-series approximations - can get more complicated statistics for the plug-in principle using linear approximations
* Parametric families and maximum likelihood theory - theoretical SE using MLE
* Simulation and the bootstrap
* Pivotal statistics - a statistic whose distribution does not depend on the underlying distribution of the data (such two sample t-test)
