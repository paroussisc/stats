## James–Stein Estimation and Ridge Regression

# James-Stein Estimator

- Empirical mean and standard deviation used for prior, then standard Bayesian update for Gaussians gives, for $\hat{M}$ empirical unbiased prior, $\hat{B}$ the unbiased posterior estimate of $B=\frac{A}{A+1}$ ($A$ being the prior standard deviation):

$$\hat{\mu}^{JS}_i = \hat{M} + \hat{B}(x_i - \hat{M})$$ for $i=1, 2,..., N,$ or equivalently in vector form.

This is Empirical Bayes again. It won't perform as well as Bayes Rule but the increased risk (mean squared error) isn't that big.
