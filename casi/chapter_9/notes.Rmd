## Survival Analysis and the EM Algorithm

- (For the life insurance example:) Hazard rate is the probability of dying at age $i$ given survival until age $i-1$.

The EM algorithm: (Expectation-maximisation) 

- Begin by filling in missing data in some way
- Then:
    - Maximise likelihood over filled-in data ("M" step)
    - Replace missing values by its conditional expectation, given the non-missing data ("E" step)
    - Repeat the EM steps until the change in parameters is sufficiently small
  
In exponential families the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the MLE based on just the observed data.
